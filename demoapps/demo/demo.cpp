/**
   This demo provides a synthetic application which intentionally uses
   most of the GraphLab V2 features.  Most GraphLab applications will
   not use all of these features.

   Picture of grid model:

      x----x----x
      |    |    |
      x----o----o
      |    |    |
      o----x----x

   Given a DIMxDIM undirected grid graph where each vertex is assigned
   a random color, either black or red.  Each vertex then makes a
   local random decision:

   - become red with probabilty proportionate to the number of red
   neighbors

   - become black with probabilty proportionate to the number of black
   neighbors

   Clearly, the two stable outcomes are where all vertices are black,
   or where all vertices are red. We are interested in knowing how
   many flips each vertex took on average.

   Also, since GraphLab only has directed edges, we will build the
   graph by duplicating every edge in both directions.

*/


// standard C++ headers
#include <iostream>

// includes the entire graphlab framework
#include <graphlab.hpp>

// A simple enum describing the two possible colors
enum color_type {RED, BLACK};

/**
   First we will design the graph data. For each vertex, we will need
   to know its current color, and a counter to count the number of
   flips it took.

   GraphLab provides facilities to directly save/load graphs from
   disk. However, to do so, GraphLab must be able to understand your
   datastructures.  If you are not interested in saving/loading
   graphs, you can simply inherit from
   unsupported_serialize. Otherwise, you will need write a save/load
   function pair for your struct.

   To write a save/load function see the commented region in the
   struct.  The serialization mechanism is simple to use and it
   understands all basic datatypes as well as standard STL
   containers. If the STL container contains non-basic datatypes (such
   as a struct), save/load functions must be written for the datatype.

  size_t     num_flips;

/** 
 * In this example, we do not need edge data. However GraphLab
 * currently does not have a mechanism to completely disable the use

 * edge type.

/**
   Now we can begin to write the update function class. GraphLab V2
   supports only one update function but since the update function is
   now a class and can hold state, it is easy to simulate multiple
   different update functions.

   \param context 

   The context provides access to a local neighborhood of a vertex
   (context.vertex_id()) in the graph.  The context includes all
   adjacent edges and vertices.  All vertex and edge ids are
   identified by the vertex_id_type and edge_id_type.


   GraphLab guarantees that all vertices are sequentially numbered
   from 0 (so the largest vertex id is |num_vertices| - 1), and
   similarly for edges.  All edges are directed.

   \param scheduler
   There are two basic types of schedulers.
   The synchronous / round_robin scheduler takes a single fixed set of tasks
   and repeatedly executes them until some termination condition is achieved.
   Using these schedulers generally means that the update function will not use
   this parameter.

   The task schedulers, which include fifo, multiqueue_fifo, priority,
   clustered_priority, all operate on the idea that executing an
   update_function on a vertex can be thought of as a task. Update functions
   can therefore inject new jobs into the task scheduler through this parameter.
   Since the task scheduler is slightly more complex to use, in this example,
   we will demonstrate task schedulers. Each update will decide whether to 
   schedule its neighbors, and the algorithm terminates when there are no
   tasks remaining. (See the comments in update_function for details).

   There are other methods for terminating execution, such as registering a
   termination evaluator with the engine, but we are not going to describe
   that here.

  As a final comment. Since the update function only requires reading of

  Sequential consistency is not guaranteed under --scope=vertex, though it could
  be quite difficult in practice to construct a race.
