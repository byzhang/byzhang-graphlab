/**
   \ingroup rpc
Sender for the dc class.
  The job of the sender is to take as input data blocks of
  pieces which should be sent to a single destination socket.
  This can be thought of as a sending end of a multiplexor.
  This class performs buffered transmissions using an blocking 
  queue with one call per queue entry.
  A seperate thread is used to transmit queue entries. Rudimentary
  write combining is used to decrease transmission overhead.
  This is typically the best performing sender.
  
  This can be enabled by passing "buffered_queued_send=yes"
  in the distributed control initstring.
  
  dc_buffered_stream_send22 is similar, but does not perform write combining.
